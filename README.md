<p>A small module adding some basic emotes accessible via the Token Controls bar that players can use whenever they want to have some fun! An emote can be applied to multiple tokens at once as long as they are owned, so if the GM wants to emote surprised on a pack of baddies that can be done as well. All animations use the brilliant Sequencer module.</p>
